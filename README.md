# Skin + Me
We are on a mission to change the face of skincare, and we’d love for you to join us. Right now, there’s a huge problem in the world of skincare: people don’t just struggle with their skin – they struggle with how they’re supposed to deal with it. The truth is that getting great skin isn’t complicated. It’s actually just about using the right combination of prescription-strength ingredients, with a stripped-back supporting routine. Simple, right? We believe it should be. We’re united in the belief that everyone should have access to expertise, effective derm-strength ingredients and treatment plans that result in clear, healthy skin – just without the big price tag and the long dermatologist waitlist that usually comes with it.

## Values
We are thoroughly committed to and live by our values;

### Embrace the unknown
Building an incredible brand from scratch comes with challenges, and we're ok with that. In fact, we're thrilled and driven by it. We're autonomous in our forging of new, exciting paths every day. And we embrace the inevitable ambiguity and uncertainty of start-up life with courage, conviction, thoughtful communication.

### Obsess over customer delight
It goes without saying that our customers are at the core of everything we do. Right now, in their lives, they're fed up with the skincare world and the false promises from products that never work. We frame every decision on their happiness at the heart, which means we grow a loyal group of brand advocates whose lives are better because of what we do.

### Challenge and be challenged
Coldplay once sang 'Nobody said it was easy', and we agree. Every day presents new challenges, and our job to rise up to them, then challenge them ourselves. We ask questions (across every area of the business). Then we question the answers. In return, we're open to getting the same back. Because in the long run, we know we'll all be better for it.


# Front-end assessment

## Purpose
The purpose of the task is to get an understanding of how you would approach a problem like this, demonstrate some of your core technical skills and to serve as a basis of the follow-up interview which will be conducted with the Engineering Manager and one of our Senior Developers.

## Task
Using the figma design and json file provided it would be great if you could mock-up a front-end react app, and share a private repository (including a README so we can reproduce/run the code).

What we’d like to see
- Responsive components built mobile first. (We have provided the desktop design, feel free to layout the other views)
- We would like the componets to be reusable, so they could be used in other areas of the site without editing. 
- Read the content from the JSON file and render it in the components. 
- Make the “Readme” package icon clickable.
- We would like you to create a private repository in your github account and commit your code to it. We would urge you to commit relatively frequently so we can get an idea of your style and approach.
