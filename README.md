# frontend-assessment

Using the figma design and json file provided It would be great if you could mock-up a front-end react app, and share a private repository (including a README so we can reproduce/run the code).

What we’d like to see
- Responsive components built mobile first. (We have provided the desktop design, feel free to layout the other views)
- Read the content from the JSON file and render it in the components. 
- Make the “Readme” package icon clickable.
